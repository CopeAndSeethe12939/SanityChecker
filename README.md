A VERY simple, basic gateway framework for proxy checking. The script itself is insanely basic and easily translated into lessor languages like Python (lulz).

Do NOT run it out of the box. Read the code, read my hints, experiment and keep anything from writing to ".htaccess" off until you are happy with it. Every site will have different needs. The code is written in a way that is easy to adapt for any site with even skiddy coding level of knowledge (you can tell it was written over a long time with my own PHP coding differing over time).

One varient I made was to change the ".htaccess" from deny to redirect to a Pay-per-click link, imagine how frustrated your attackers get when they earn you money for failing !

You may only need to use a few portions of the code. This is mainly used to track (ab)users to your site. If you are uncertain what some of the routines in this do, keep them either disabled or non-auto adding to .htaccess

Now grab a 12939 and watch skiddies cope and seethe while you mock them !
